I want to see how much of my expenses are going to food, wants, bills, etc.
These are the categories I can think of. Let's keep them few in number.
food
rent
maintenance (health, expenses to maintain equipment)
bills
transport
want

Todo:
make cash CSVs easier to make

commands available in the shell:
cat 0 category
type 0 cash
