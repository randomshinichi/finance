I want to see how much of my expenses are going to food, wants, bills, etc.
These are the categories I can think of. Let's keep them few in number.
food
rent
maintenance (health, expenses to maintain equipment)
bills
transport
want

Todo:
when I type show food, I should get food expenditures from both cash and debit, with the total between them

my CSVs will follow this format:
date,category,details,amount

commands available in the shell:
cat 0 category
type 0 cash

show (type) (category)
show debit food
show cash uncategorized
show all
