I want to see how much of my expenses are going to food, wants, bills, etc.
These are the categories I can think of. Let's keep them few in number.
food
rent
infrastructure (new equipment necessary for survival)
maintenance (health, expenses to maintain equipment)
bills
transport
want
social (food/drink costs incurred by social activities)
